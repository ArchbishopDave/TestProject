This project was founded by David Bright, 5/6/2011.

A Massive Battlefield in which the player can battle on.

Features needed to be added as of 5/16, 10:30 PM.
---------------------------
1. Factions (Sides in which the units are on. Currently it is an FFA)
2. Killing of Units (Enable both the player to die and the troops on the battlefield)
3. Proper controls (Currently left and right turn that direction, have it so where the stick is pointing, the unit goes.)
